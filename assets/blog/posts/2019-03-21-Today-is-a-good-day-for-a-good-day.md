Are you sick? Have stupid peoples? Do yo have a hard job?

> Dont worry! Calm down!

As I mentioned before, there were many problems and more things in my life that hard to live with. Most of them were unbelivable.
Just to remember:

- brainstem inflammation
- had to take steroids
  - distention
  - being agressive
- thigh fracture
- continous tynnitus
- stress
- bad relationship and can't free from it. (it is the worst)
- solitude
- parents divorced

However, these are only unfortunate events. Nothing can stop living. I realized, and sometime everyone will do so, that the fortune is just a word.

> The one what people call as fortune, is a state when there are both preparedness and opportunity

Maybe there is the question, why I changed the posts language to english. So, the answer is easy. I changed my way of thinking about life and it is seemly to change everything else too.
The locations, the car, the usual places... everything what was bad. Every good thing take place from a bad thing, so if you have enough good in your life, there wont't be place for sadness.

The success is completely depends on your attitude, however some things can be easier during this process.

1. The first thing I would like to highlight is the way of change. There should be a turn of event in your life. It makes the change much easier. There should be a choice. When you would like to change something, you want to find an other way of something.
For example: If you would like break with someone, there will be a fear in your mind that you will stay alone. Because of this fear, it is much easier to achive, if you have someone to whom you can rely spiritually. A love, a friend, a girlfriend...
__The change is always easier if you know what is waiting for you if it happened. Noone likes uncertanity__. 

2. The other thing is love. Love of yourself. Self-esteem. __Stop self-pity!!__ These are common phrases, but:
- You are valuable to happiness!
- Nobody deserves to be nervous about her!
- Just tell yourself many times: i'm brave, i'm valuable, i rule my life, i'm in this moment!
